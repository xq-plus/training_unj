The plush material is incredibly soft and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I noticed one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, suggesting this may not have been an intentional design feature. Additionally, while it was a pleasant surprise to receive the item ahead of schedule, allowing me some personal enjoyment before gifting it to my daughter, the toy appears somewhat small relative to its price point. There might be alternative options available that offer a larger size at the same cost.\n\nOverall, despite these minor drawbacks, the panda plush remains endearing and has brought considerable joy to both my daughter and myself.\n```"},"metadata":{}}],"source":["prompt = f\"\"\"\n","proofread and correct this review.
